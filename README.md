# SortingVisualiser

This application was created for my A level project.

Algorithms visualied:
  Bubble Sort,
  Merge Sort,
  Quick Sort,
  Radix Sort,
  Insertion Sort,
  Selection Sort.

All sorting algorithms are called #####Sort.cs, Sort.cs is used to visualise these.

You can watch a video of the application here: https://youtu.be/CxwfOmo91z0.

Future updates may include a database for the game and smoother visuals.
